THIS IS OPTIMAL SOLUTION 
**Approach** 
First, we calculate the effective rotation steps k by taking the modulus of k with the size of the array n. This ensures that k is within the range [0, n).
We then reverse the entire array. This effectively moves the last k elements to the front.
After reversing, the first k elements in the array are the elements that should be at the end of the rotated array. So, we reverse only the first k elements to bring them to their correct positions.
Finally, we reverse the rest of the elements in the array after the first k elements. This brings the remaining elements back to their correct positions after rotation.

**Complexity**
Time complexity:O(N)
Space complexity:O(1)
